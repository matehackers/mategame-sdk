Space Invaders (Hardware Freedom Day edition)
====================

This is based on the code available in the [Hackvision firmware](http://nootropicdesign.com/hackvision/games.html). Several things were refactored and made to compile in the latest `gcc` and `gcc-avr` and some modifications were made to draw some HFDay related stuff.
